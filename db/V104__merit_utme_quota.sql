-- V104 — the criteria fill the UTME quota; National Merit is the highest UTME
--        total scores, any origin; Direct Entry is its own stream
--
--   The selection criteria (National Merit, State Merit, ELG, Locality) are a
--   UTME concept: the downloaded sheet sizes each one's seats off the UTME quota
--   (UTME Quota = the programme quota × the faculty's UTME share). V103 sized
--   them off the WHOLE programme quota and ranked UTME and Direct Entry together,
--   so "National Merit for UTME" was neither UTME-sized nor UTME-scoped.
--
--   Now, per entry mode:
--     · the programme quota is split UTME:DE by the faculty ratio;
--     · within the UTME quota, National Merit is the highest UTME total scores
--       irrespective of origin, up to its share, then State Merit (Benue) from
--       below the National Merit line, then ELG, then Locality — each up to its
--       share of the UTME quota;
--     · the Direct Entry quota is filled the same way among Direct Entry
--       candidates, off the DE quota.
--   A candidate below a stream's merit line who fits no reserved category is not
--   offered here — the Board works the waiting list. No quota set: every
--   eligible candidate is admitted on merit.
